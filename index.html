        <p class="desc-1">Meet Earth—our slightly chaotic, mostly water-covered roommate in space. She's been spinning around the Sun for about 4.5 billion years, somehow managing to support oceans, forests, pizza delivery, and finals week all at once. Earth is the only planet we know that hosts life, Wi-Fi anxiety, and group chats that never die. She's not perfect (earthquakes, bugs, taxes), but she's got vibes—and an atmosphere that literally keeps us alive, so credit where it's due.</p>
        <p class="desc-2">EARTH FUN FACTS:</p>
        <ul class="desc-3">
            <li>She's mostly water: About 71% of Earth's surface is ocean, yet humans still manage to dehydrate daily.</li>
            <li>Earth is speedy: We're spinning at about 1,670 km/h at the equator—and you don't even feel it. Physics is wild.</li>
            <li>Not actually round: Earth is a slightly squished sphere (an oblate spheroid), meaning it's thicker around the middle. Relatable.</li>
