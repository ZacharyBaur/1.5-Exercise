        <p class="desc-1">Meet the Moon—Earth's ride-or-die companion that's been hanging around for billions of years, quietly controlling tides and dramatically improving night aesthetics. She doesn't produce her own light (still iconic), but reflects the Sun like a cosmic influencer. The Moon is calm, mysterious, and emotionally distant—yet without her, Earth would be a wobbly mess. Low maintenance, high impact.

        <p class="desc-2">MOON FUN FACTS:</p>
        <ul class="desc-3">
            <li>Always shows the same face: The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, meaning we only ever see one side. Commitment issues? None.</li>
            <li>Gravity glow-up: The Moon's gravity causes ocean tides on Earth—proof that you can affect things from afar.</li>
            <li>Footprints last forever: There's no wind or weather up there, so astronaut footprints can stick around for millions of years. Talk about leaving a legacy.</li>
